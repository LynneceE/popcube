                                 I'm a <span><b>fullstack</b></span> web development student, 
                                 but backend development stole my heart! I've completed the <span><b>MERN</b></span> stack.
                                 I was born and raised in Miami, Fl but now live in San Antonio, Tx. I guess city life really isn't for me.
                                 Feel free to look around, I've linked some of my work in the <span><b>Portfolio</b></span> tab.
                                 I'm looking forward to working with you!
